The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods
are called. What happens when you donâ€™t update for them to catch?

If an exception arises when calling the play() methods, your application will terminate if you don't 
change the code to handle these errors. Loss of unsaved data and a bad user experience may result from this.
